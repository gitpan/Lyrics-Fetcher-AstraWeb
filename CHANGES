0.33  2008/04/24 - use quotemeta before using $artist and $title in regexps,
  so that we don't break if they contain meta characters - thanks go to
  Joshua Soles (JBSOLES) for reporting this bug!
  
0.32  2008/02/21 - I stupidly forgot to declare WWW::Mech as a dependency in
  Makefile.PL, leading to test failures.
  
0.31  2008/02/19 - inprove package to improve its poor "Kwalitee" score

0.3 - 2007/07/06 - Lyrics::Fetcher::AstraWeb split off from Lyrics::Fetcher to
  become a package in its own right.
